Welcome to Mascot.ga
======
Mascot.ga is an easy to use mascot maker that allows you to create awesome mascots in seconds with the click of a couple of buttons. Our purpose with creating Mascot.ga was to provide you a simple and fun experience while making mascots. Once you create your mascots, you can then use them on your websites, on your graphics materials, in your marketing campaigns and even in your projects for your clients.

Mascot.ga is built to be as simple and user friendly as possible. The tool is pretty self-explanatory and you will most probably get used to using it after you create your first mascot. However, we also have detailed tutorials for you here, and we highly recommend that you go through them before you start.

If you need further assistance, you can contact our support on this page but before submitting a support ticket please make sure that you went through the tutorials and our knowlege base which has additional answers for common questions. Please also let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions to improve Mascot.ga.
